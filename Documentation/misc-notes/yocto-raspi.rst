Yocto: Raspberry Image
======================


.. sidebar::

   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases

* https://www.codeinsideout.com/blog/yocto/raspberry-pi/
* Only with branch ``kirkstone``, not ``dunfell`` (which still uses
  Python ``asyncore``)

  Would have rather used ``scarthgap`` which is the newest LTS, but
  that is not yet supported by ``meta-raspberrypi``.
